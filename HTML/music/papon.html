        <P>Papon, born Angaraag Mahanta, is a unique and revered voice in the Indian music industry, effortlessly bridging the gap between the soulful depths of Assamese folk music and the vibrant world of contemporary Bollywood playback. He is instantly recognizable for his rich, earthy baritone and a distinctive vocal style that carries the raw, organic essence of his Northeastern roots. While he gained national fame with the hauntingly beautiful "**Jiyein Kyun**" from *Dum Maaro Dum* and the romantic anthem "**Moh Moh Ke Dhaage**" from *Dum Laga Ke Haisha*, his work extends far beyond films. As a pioneer of the independent music scene, he has passionately worked to bring folk traditions to a modern audience, both through his own band, East India Company, and his collaborations. This dual identity—as both a cherished folk ambassador and a sought-after Bollywood singer—cements Papon's status as a truly authentic and influential artist in the Indian musical landscape.</P>
