        <P>Vishal Mishra has firmly established himself as one of the most soulful and distinctive voices in the contemporary Hindi film playback singing scene. While he began his journey as a music composer, it was his raw and powerful vocal talent that catapulted him to widespread recognition. He is celebrated for his ability to infuse immense emotion and a rock-edged grit into his performances, making every song he sings feel intensely personal and heartfelt. His breakthrough came with the massively popular "**Tera Ban Jaunga**" from *Kabir Singh*, and he has since delivered a string of unforgettable hits like "**Kaise Hua**" from *Kabir Singh*, "**Naina**" from *Crew*, and the introspective "**Samjhawan**" (Unplugged). Not just a singer, but also a skilled composer and lyricist, Vishal Mishra's multifaceted talent and passionate delivery make him a standout artist in the new generation of Indian music.</P>
